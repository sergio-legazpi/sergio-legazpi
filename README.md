# Hi, I'm Sergio 👋

My name is Sergio, and I studied the **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering** at the **University of Coruña**, specifically specializing in **Software Engineering**. Currently, I am pursuing the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering (MUEI) at the University of Coruña.

If I had to say something that clearly defines me, it would be my capacity for hard work and adaptation, along with a collaborative spirit and a positive attitude towards challenges.
