# Hi, I'm Sergio 👋

My name is Sergio, and I studied the **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering** at the **University of Coruña**, specifically specializing in **Software Engineering**. Currently, I am pursuing the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering (MUEI) at the University of Coruña.

If I had to say something that clearly defines me, it would be my capacity for hard work and adaptation, along with a collaborative spirit and a positive attitude towards challenges.

## 🚀 External Projects

### HFLAV FAIR Client

Scientific software project developed in collaboration with **HFLAV (Heavy Flavor Averaging Group)**, an international collaboration associated with **CERN**.

This project provides a **FAIR-compliant Python client** that acts as a bridge between scientific data repositories and end users, with **Zenodo** as the primary backend. It automates dataset discovery, download, and validation, reducing manual data handling while improving reproducibility, traceability, and reuse of official HFLAV results.

**Key features:**
- FAIR-compliant data access workflows  
- Automated discovery and retrieval of datasets  
- JSON Schema–based data and metadata validation  
- High-level Python API for scientific analysis  
- Extensible, backend-agnostic architecture  
- Support for reproducible and open science
